# MarketMind Infrastructure & Ops

This folder is reserved for infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and operational configs.

Examples of what may live here in the future:

- Terraform/Pulumi for non-Vercel resources (e.g., S3 buckets, data warehouse)
- Monitoring & alerting configs
- CDN rules, security policies, etc.
