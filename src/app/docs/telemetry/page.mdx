# ML pipeline

This page exists to give you a **mental model of the ML pipeline** that feeds the
MarketMind meta-learning control plane and C++/GPU runtime.

Rather than thinking in terms of one-off scripts, you should think of a **pipeline graph**
that transforms raw market data into features, model outputs, and finally meta-strategy
decisions.

## Stages in the pipeline

At a high level, a typical pipeline has five stages:

1. **Ingest**
   - Normalize and validate tick, bar, and reference data.
   - Handle replay, backfill, and real-time feeds through a common interface.

2. **Feature engineering**
   - Compute sliding-window features, technical factors, and regime descriptors.
   - Cache intermediate results with a multi-tier cache (L1–L4) to keep hot paths warm.

3. **Model inference**
   - Run models (e.g., Transformers, sequence models, classical models) exported to ONNX.
   - Use GPU-accelerated inference where latency or throughput demands it.

4. **Meta-learning layer**
   - Combine signals from multiple strategies.
   - Select, weight, and decay strategies per regime and risk budget.
   - Emit final position targets or order recommendations to the execution core.

5. **Risk &amp; execution handoff**
   - Apply pre-trade checks, limits, and overlays.
   - Hand off decisions to the C++ execution router, which handles venue-specific details.

## Authoring pipelines

In practice you&apos;ll author pipelines in Python:

- Define a **feature graph** describing dependencies and scheduling.
- Attach models and post-processing steps to nodes in that graph.
- Export models and configuration in a form the C++ runtime understands.

This stub intentionally omits the exact API. Once the Python SDK is stable, this page
should be updated with real code examples and configuration snippets.

## Next steps

- Read the [Architecture](/architecture) page for the system-level picture.
- Browse the [Telemetry &amp; metrics](/docs/telemetry) page to see how to measure the
  pipeline in production.
- If you haven&apos;t already, go through the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) to get a
  minimal end-to-end flow running.
