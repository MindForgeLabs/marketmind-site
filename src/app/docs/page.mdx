# MarketMind Documentation

MarketMind is a **meta-learning control plane** running on top of an **ultra-low-latency C++/GPU runtime** for systematic trading.

These docs are written for:

- Quant researchers and PMs who want regime-aware strategies.
- Infra and platform engineers who care about latency, observability, and safety.
- Power users integrating MarketMind into existing research and execution stacks.

## Information architecture

The docs are organized into four major areas:

### Getting Started

Fastest way to see something work end-to-end.

- [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) – install the client, run health checks, execute a minimal pipeline.
- **Installation** – coming soon.

### Guides

Task-oriented guides that walk through common workflows.

- [Running pipelines](/docs/pipelines) – how to define, schedule, and monitor pipelines. _(stub)_
- [Strategy examples](/docs/strategies) – examples of single-strategy and meta-strategy setups. _(stub)_

### Concepts

Background material and system-level mental models.

- [Architecture](/architecture) – high-level system design and core components.
- [Meta-learning & regimes](/docs/meta-learning) – how regime detection and policy selection work. _(stub)_
- [Risk model](/docs/risk) – kill switches, limits, and overlays. _(stub)_

### API Reference

Deep dives and generated references.

- [Python API (Read the Docs)](https://docs.marketmind.ai/) – full API reference. _(placeholder URL)_
- [Configuration schema](/docs/config) – key config options and examples. _(stub)_

## Where to start

If you want to **see something work in 5–10 minutes**, start with the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart).

If you want a **system-level picture first**, read the [Architecture](/architecture) and [Performance](/performance) pages, then come back here for specific guides.
